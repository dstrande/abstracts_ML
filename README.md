# abstracts_ML
Medical Abstracts Machine Learning Project


This document describes the machine learning project to fit sentence in medical abstracts into different classifications such as background, methods, results, etc. The source of the data is: \par

<kaggle.com/datasets/anshulmehtakaggl/200000-abstracts-for-seq-sentence-classification>

The data was modeled in the notebook data_processing.ipynb which can be found here.

Note that the data is not included here due to file size restrictions. The repository also contains a Python script for creating and comparing multiple models. The comparison was performed using tensorboard. In logs.zip you can find the tensorboard logs files.
