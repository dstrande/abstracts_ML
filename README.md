# abstracts_ML
Medical Abstracts Machine Learning Project


This document describes the machine learning project to fit sentence in medical abstracts into different classifications such as background, methods, results, etc. The source of the data is: 

kaggle.com/datasets/anshulmehtakaggl/200000-abstracts-for-seq-sentence-classification

The smaller 20k dataset was modeled in the notebook NLP.ipynb first to compare models faster.

Two datasets were chosen them the larger 200k dataset was then modeled to properly train the models.
